# CGP9018M-2021-Lab-Codebase
Codebase for OpenGL Labs for 2021 on CGP9018M-2021 Advanced Graphics

Use visual studio to build. You'll need to run CMake to generate the project files in the /build dir. Set the startup project to each lab as you work through them. 

Note: This code is based off the tutorials mentioned in each lab .cpp file, be sure you go and do those too.

Also note: This isn't "good" code. In fact its pretty terrible. I expect you to work on your own codebase and make it usable for your own tastes. This is mainly just to get us started discussing a topic.
